# keycuts
keyboard shortcuts for nerds.... Open any file/folder/URL with Win+R and the shortcut name.

keycuts is a tool for creating simple scripts to open **anything** on your computer using a nickname.

How do you launch a keycut?
* Type "Win+R", the shortcut name, and Enter.

Examples:
* "npp" opens Notepad++
* "rb" opens the Recycle Bin
* "gmail" opens new tab for email
* "timesheet" opens new tab for timesheet page
* "db" opens Dropbox folder
* "ss" opens screenshots folder

Create keycuts several ways:
* UI -- open the app, drag in the destination file, and name it
* Right click menu -- opens the app with the destination filled in
* CLI -- for all the hard-core nerds and brogrammers
* Common -- for forking your own implementation
